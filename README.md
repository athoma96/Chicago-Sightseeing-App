# Chicago-Sightseeing-App

      A simple Flutter Tour app of Chicago that gives options about what to see, where to sleep and what to eat in Chicago. 
      The home screen allows the user to select one of three choices in each of three categories: Neighborhoods, Events and Sports. Each of the choices has 
      an image associated with it's name to the right. When the user presses on the image of the option, the image will hero swoop into the next page where             
      there will be a brief description and an address of the choice. 
      Each choice page will also have an more info button at the bottom which will provide facts and trivia on a separate dialog box about the selected
      choice.
